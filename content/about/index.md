I’m eremit4, an intelligence professional who walks between domains — from the human layer to the machine layer, from what is visible to what hides in the shadows.

My personal mission is to move quietly across digital terrain: tracking adversaries, uncovering hidden behaviors, dissecting malware, developing tools that sharpen my perception in the field, and confronting formidable enemies when the darkness demands it.

This space is my place of solitude — a dim refuge at the edge of the digital wilderness, where I record operations, findings, and missions that deserve to be preserved in written form for wandering strangers like you.
Just be aware: not everything that hides in the dark wishes to remain unseen.

All thoughts and opinions expressed here are entirely my own and do not represent any third parties.
